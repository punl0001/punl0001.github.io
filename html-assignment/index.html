<article><h3>About Me</h3></article>
<p>The sun was our god, the mountains our father and the earth our mother. <strong>Tahuantinsuyo</strong> was the land of hunters, farmers, warriors and stargazers, this is how we did it in Peru before we were massacred and conquered by the spanish in a battle of arrows and axes against horses and guns. Today, almost 500 years later, much of our history has been forgotten.</p>

<p>This is where my passion for identity was born. As an audiovisual advertiser, I had to take advantage of all the culture that surrounded me and transmit it through my work. Peru is a rich country in every sense. there are many things to enjoy including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>history</li>
    <li>food</li>
    <li>travel</li>
    <li>surfing</li>
</ul>

<aside>
    <p>I grew up in Lima, Peru and all the things I love about my country, the mysticism, the food, beautiful landscapes and the warrior culture, are all a part of who I am. </p>
