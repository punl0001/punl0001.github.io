<p>The sun was our god, the mountains our father and the earth our mother. <strong>Tahuantinsuyo</strong> was the land of hunters, farmers, warriors and stargazers, this is how we did it in Peru before we were massacred and conquered by the spanish in a battle of arrows and axes against horses and guns. Today, almost 500 years later, much of our history has been forgotten.</p>

<p>This is where my passion for identity was born. Being the <abbr title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</abbr> of my company, as an audiovisual advertiser, I had to take advantage of all the culture that surrounded me and transmit it through my work. Peru is a rich country in every sense. there are many things to enjoy.</p>
