# Welcome to my first readme file!
This is a readme file for my final project. We're learning Markdown

### The challenges
1. I didn't like my UX design, it wasn't completed and I made it without thinking about execution and functionality, now I know how important it is to have a good design and not rush things or not get excited just because it looks good.

2. The Sidebar NAV that was originally designed gave me a lot of headaches and the size of the picture in the homepage was too big.

3. I haven't been able to finish any of my websites for this class, so finish the final Website on time was my main challenge, I've been struggling a bit with the timing. Since I did good in Bootstrap I decided to not use it in this project at all so I could practice more what I haven't been able to do.

### Overcoming the changes
- About the design, I designed a better looking footer and added some buttons, I controlled the margins, made the site look organized and added some color for more contrast.

- About the side bar I gave up on that design and I just went for a horizontal navbar in the top of the site for desktop size. I optimized all of my pictures to a decent size.

- I watched some videos, started to work on time and I even finished a week earlier than the due date. Even thought it is a simple website I am proud of the results, I could achieve almost everything I wanted.

<br>
Creating my portfolio I learned that it is important to know what are you going to do, have everything clear since the UX design so you don't have problems while coding, being organized is key and mostly not loose the patience, it's easy to get frustrated for any mistake you can't solve easily.
